    "## Sound Pressure, Power and Loundness\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sound wave there are extremely small periodic variations in atmospheric pressure to which our ears respond in a rather complex manner. The minimum pressure\n",
    "fluctuation to which the ear can respond is less than one billionth ($10^{-9}$ ) of atmospheric\n",
    "pressure. (This is even more remarkable when we consider that storm fronts can cause\n",
    "the atmospheric pressure to change by as much as 5 to 10% in a few minutes.) The\n",
    "threshold of audibility, which varies from person to person, typically corresponds to\n",
    "a sound pressure amplitude of about $2x10^{-5} N/m2$ at a frequency of 1000 Hz. The\n",
    "threshold of pain corresponds to a pressure amplitude approximately one million ($10^6$)\n",
    "times greater, but still less than 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure.\n",
    "Because of the wide range of pressure stimuli, it is convenient to measure sound\n",
    "pressures on a logarithmic scale, called the decibel (dB) scale. Although a decibel scale\n",
    "is actually a means for comparing two sounds, we can define a decibel scale of sound level\n",
    "by comparing sounds with a reference sound having a pressure amplitude $p_0 = 2 x 10^{-5}\n",
    "N/m^2$ assigned a sound pressure level of 0 dB. Thus we define sound pressure level as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_p = 20 log p/p_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Expressed in other units, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_0 =20 \\mu Pa = 2 \\times 10^{-4} dynes / cm2 = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\mu bars\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For comparison, atmospheric pressure is $10^5 N/m^2$ , or $lO^6 \\mu bars$. Sound pressure levels are\n",
    "measured by a sound level meter, consisting of a microphone, an amplifier, and a meter\n",
    "that reads in decibels.\n",
    "In addition to the sound pressure level, there are other levels expressed in decibels,\n",
    "so one must be careful when reading technical articles about sound or regulations on\n",
    "environmental noise. One such level is the sound power level, which identifies the total\n",
    "sound power emitted by a source in all directions. Sound power, like electrical power,\n",
    "is measured in watts (one watt equals one joule of energy per second). In the case of\n",
    "sound, the amount of power is very small, so the reference selected for comparison is\n",
    "the picowatt (10- 12 watt). The sound power level (in decibels) is defined as\n",
    "$ L_w = 10 log W_p /W_0 $,  \n",
    "where W_p is the sound power emitted by the source, and the reference power $W_0 = 10^{-12} W$.\n",
    "Another quality described by a decibel level is sound intensity, which is the rate\n",
    "of energy flow across a unit area. The reference for measuring sound intensity level is\n",
    "[ 0 = 10-12 $W/m^2$ , and the sound intensity level is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i = 10logI/I_0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For a free progressive wave in air (e.g., a plane wave traveling down a tube or a spherical\n",
    "wave traveling outward from a source), sound pressure level and sound intensity level\n",
    "are nearly equal ($L_p \\approx L_i$). This is not true in general, however, because sound waves\n",
    "from many directions contribute to sound pressure at a point.\n",
    "The relationship between sound pressure level and sound power level depends on\n",
    "several factors, including the geometry of the source and the room. If the sound power\n",
    "level of a source is increased by 10 dB, the sound pressure level also increases by 10\n",
    "dB, provided everything else remains the same. If a source radiates sound equally in all\n",
    "directions and there are no reflecting surfaces nearby (a free field), the sound pressure\n",
    "level decreases by 6 dB each time the distance from the source doubles.\n",
    "Loudness is a subjective quality. While loudness depends very much on the sound\n",
    "pressure level, it also depends upon such things as the frequency, the spectrum, the\n",
    "duration, and the amplitude envelope of the sound, plus the environmental conditions\n",
    "under which it is heard and the auditory condition of the listener.\n",
    "Loudness is frequently expressed in sones. One sone is equal to the loudness of a\n",
    "1000-Hz tone at a 40-dB sound pressure level, and two sones describes a sound that is\n",
    "judged twice as loud, etc. The dependence of subjective loudness on sound pressure is\n",
    "discussed in connection with Demonstration 7."

    "\n",
    "##### Background\n",
    "Timbre can be defined as \"that attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which a listener can judge that two sounds similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch are dissimilar...\". According to this definition, timbre is the subjective correlate of all those sound properties that do not directly influence pitch or loudness. These properties include the sound's spectral power distribution, its temporal envelope, rate and depth of amplitude or frequency modulation, and the degree of non-harmonicity of its partials. The timbre of a sound therefore depends on many physical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of timbre plays a very important role in the orchestration of traditional music and in the composition of computer music. There is, however, no satisfying comprehensive theory of timbre perception. Neither is there a uniform nomenclature to designate or classify timbre. This poses considerable problems in communicating or teaching the skills of orchestration and computer score writing to student-composers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The demonstration\n",
    "In the following demonstrations, one can hear the influence of spectral make-up on the perceived timbre of sounds of musical instruments.\n",

    " \n",
    "The sound of a Hermony carillon bell, having a strike-note pitch around 500 Hz (B4), is synthesized in eight steps by adding successive partials with their original frequency, phase and temporal envelope. The partials added in successive steps are:\n",

    "- Hume note (251 Hz)\n",
    "- Prime or Fundamental (501 Hz)\n",
    "- Minor Third and Fifth (603, 750 Hz)\n",
    "- Octave or Nominal (1005 Hz)\n",
    "- Duodecime or Twelfth (1506 Hz)\n",
    "- Upper Octave (2083 Hz)\n",
    "- Next two partials (2421, 2721 Hz)\n",
    "- Remainder of partials\n",

    "Demonstration 2: Guitar\n",
