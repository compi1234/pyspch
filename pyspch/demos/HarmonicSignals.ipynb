    "## Pitch and Timbre\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitch of Pure Tones\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch is often defined as the characteristic of a sound that makes it sound high or\n",
    "low, or that determines its position on a musical scale. Pitch is related to the repetition\n",
    "rate of the waveform of a sound. For a pure tone, this corresponds to the frequency; for\n",
    "a 'complex tone it usually (but not always) corresponds to the fundamental frequency.\n",
    "Frequency is the most important contributor to the sensation of pitch, but not the only\n",
    "one by any means. Other contributors to pitch include intensity, spectrum, duration,\n",
    "amplitude envelope, and the presence of other sounds.\n",
    "Various attempts have been made to establish a psychophysical pitch scale. If, after\n",
    "listening to a 4000-Hz tone followed by a tone of very low frequency, one is asked to\n",
    "tune an oscillator to a pitch halfway between, a likely choice would be around 1000 Hz.\n",
    "On a scale of pitch, then, 1000 Hz is judged halfway between 0 and 4000 Hz. The unit\n",
    "for subjective pitch is the me/; the scale is arranged so that doubling the number of mels\n",
    "doubles the subjective pitch. A scale from 0 to 2400 mels covers the audible range of\n",
    "20 to 16,000 Hz.\n",
    "A numerical scale of pitch (in mels) is not nearly so useful as a numerical scale\n",
    "of loudness (in sones), however. Pitch is more often related to a musical scale, where\n",
    "the octave is the \"natural\" pitch interval that is subdivided into the desired number of\n",
    "steps.\n",
    "Two major theories of pitch perception have been developed; they are usually referred to as the place (or frequency) theory and the periodicity (or time) theory. According to the place theory, the cochlea converts a vibration in time to a vibration pattern\n",
    "in space (along the basilar membrane), and this in turn excites a spatial pattern of\n",
    "neural activity. The place theory explains some aspects of auditory perception but fails\n",
    "to explain others.\n",
    "According to the periodicity theory of pitch, the ear performs a temporal analysis\n",
    "of the sound wave. Presumably, the time distribution of impulses carried along the\n",
    "35 \n",
    "auditory nerve has encoded into it the temporal structure of the sound wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitch of Complex Tones\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most remarkable properties of the auditory system is its ability to extract\n",
    "pitch from complex tones. When the complex tone consists of a number of harmonically\n",
    "related partials, the pitch corresponds to the \"missing fundamental.\" This pitch is often\n",
    "referred to as pitch of the missing fundamental, virtual pitch, or musical pitch.\n",
    "When the partials are not exactly harmonics of a missing fundamental, we arrive at\n",
    "a \"virtual pitch\" by some strategy that may weigh several possibilities, and when the\n",
    "choice is difficult the pitch may be ambiguous.\n",
    "Familiar examples of such virtual pitch are the bass notes we hear from loudspeakers\n",
    "of very small size that radiate negligible power at low frequencies, and the subjective\n",
    "strike note of carillon bells, tuned church bells and orchestral chimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timbre\n",
    "\n",
    "The American National Standards Institute defines timbre as \" ... that attribute of\n",
    "auditory sensation in terms of which a listener can judge that two sounds similarly\n",
    "presented and having the same loudness and pitch are dissimilar\". According to this\n",
    "definition, timbre is the subjective correlate of all those sound properties that do not\n",
    "directly influence pitch or loudness. These properties include the sound's spectral power\n",
    "distribution, its temporal envelope (as would be shown on an oscilloscope display), rate\n",
    "and depth of amplitude or frequency modulation, and the degree of inharmonicity of\n",
    "its partials. The timbre of a sound therefore depends on many physical variables. It\n",
    "has been shown that from a subjective point of view the sensation of timbre has about\n",
    "three rather orthogonal dimensions. These can be represented by the verbal ranges dullsharp, compact-scattered and colorful-colorless. These subjective dimensions are loosely\n",
    "related to the physical quantities of high-frequency energy in the attack, synchronicity\n",
    "in high-harmonic transients, and spectral power distribution.\n",
    "The concept of timbre plays a very important role in the orchestration of traditional\n",
    "music and in the composition of computer music. There is, however, no satisfying\n",
    "comprehensive theory of timbre perception. Neither is there a uniform nomenclature\n",
    "to designate or classify timbres. This poses considerable problems in communicating or\n",
    "teaching the skills of orchestration and computer score writing to student-composers.\n",
    "In the following demonstrations one can hear how spectral make-up, temporal envelope and degree of spectral inharmonicity all have a very specific influence on the\n",
    "perceived timbre of sounds from musical instruments. \n",
    "\n",
