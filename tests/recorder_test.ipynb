    "## Recorder\n",

    "Date: 17/05/2021, 20/09/2021, 24/02/2022 (v0.6), 16/02/2023 (v0.7)\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates various ways of audio recording in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- either directly via command line\n",
    "- either via the **iRecorder()** GUI \n",
    "\n",
    "#### iRecorder()\n",
    "\n",
    "is a simple Jupyter Lab / ipywidgets based GUI for speech recordings.\n",
    "- Record and Play Buttons\n",
    "- set recording time and sampling frequency\n",
    "- Save (selected part of) current recording to a named file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CAVEATS\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is not the optimal environment for interactive Audio I/O ,\n",
    "due to a 3 way potential conflict between browser / latencies and rules in jupyter client-server architecture \n",
    "/ notebook.\n",
    "Due to these various policy level, the notebook is never fully in control of what happens.\n",
    "Moreover audio hardware capabilties vary drastically between machines.\n",
    "For playback, resulting issues are manageable.  For recording, things are a bit more messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues that you may encounter include:\n",
    "- lead time in recordings:  there may be a discrepancy between the prompt to start recording and the actual start of the recording; this can be substantial (a few 100 msec), just discard these unwanted parts when saving\n",
    "- autoplay and autonormalize are features that can be overruled by the browser; you may see different behavior on Chrome vs. Firefox .. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing Files on Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write into your temporarily allocated space on colab.\n",
    "However, if you want to reuse files later, the way to go is to mount your google drive first and\n",
    "write them there.\n",
    "With the following lines of code, you will be able to access your personal google drive\n",
    "> from google.colab import drive    \n",
    "> drive.mount('/content/gdrive')    \n",
    "> gdrive_path = '/content/gdrive/My Drive/'    \n"
